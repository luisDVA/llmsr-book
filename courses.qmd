Here are some courses and guides for actually using the LLM tools listed here. Newest entries at the top, and going forward I will record the date in which I added them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This [long-form post](https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2025/ollama/) by Athanasia Mo Mowinckel goes through the setup process and various adventures for using various relevant tools including [ellmer](r-pkgs.qmd#ellmer) [chores](r-pkgs.qmd#chores), [gander](r-pkgs.qmd#gander) and [ensure](r-pkgs.qmd#ensure) with local ollama models for package development. The text shows that the tooling is not quite there yet, but on its way.

David Keyes at R for the Rest of Us recently launched "[Using AI with R](https://rfortherestofus.com/courses/ai)": a free, self-paced short course for using LLM-based assistants with R. Covers many of the tools and packages mentioned on this site.

Albert Rapp also has an in progress Quarto book "[AI with R](https://air.albert-rapp.de/)", built from his existing blog posts for addressing different tasks using AI tool and not having to work in browser-based chat boxes. This resource includes some very well-written documentation for using mall and ellmer.

Leonardo Collado Torres gave a short course that covered many of the packages and tools used here, and the recording is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qWuoVQG5BZw?si=YM7Y2s3xfcEd2Sc6). The course materials also include useful step-by-step instructions for setting up and using copilot.

My fellow UQ alum Chris Brown, now at UTAS, shared this recent entry about [summarizing key details from a methods section](https://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2025/02/12/LLMs-for-literature-reviews.html) to assist in literature reviews. The example uses [tidychatmodels](r-pkgs.qmd#tidychatmodels) and I particularly like Chris' advice: **"Iâ€™d also recommend you manually check results so that you still learn something yourself"**.

This post by Nic Crane demonstrates how we can use [ellmer](r-pkgs.qmd#ellmer) and Shiny to build an app that [creates posts for different social media platforms](https://niccrane.com/posts/socalmediagen2/).
