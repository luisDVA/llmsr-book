ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This is an ongoing roundup of useful developments in the LLM/genAI space, with a specific focus on R.


For teaching purposes and to help me keep track of what's happening, I've put together this draft listing of relevant LLM+R resources. This was initially a post on my blog from late 2024, but this book format should be easier to navigate. I will update the content periodically when new tools come out and/or when people bring them to my attention.


The logos below link to each tool's official site.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false


logos <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("images/hex/"))



urlss <- c(

samplelogos <- sample(logos)


hexsession::make_tile(local_images = samplelogos, local_urls = names(samplelogos),dark_mode = F)
