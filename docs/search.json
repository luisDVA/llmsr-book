This is an ongoing roundup of useful developments in the LLM/genAI space, with a specific focus on R.\nFor teaching purposes and to help me keep track of what’s happening, I’ve put together this draft listing of relevant LLM+R resources. This was initially a post on my blog from late 2024, but this book format should be easier to navigate. I will update the content periodically when new tools come out and/or when people bring them to my attention.\nThe logos below link to each tool’s official site.\ncreated with hexsession\nFeel free to send feedback or to edit this content via pull requests.",

    "text": "Here are some interesting and worthwhile reads to explore before getting hands-on with any of the tools listed on this site.\n\nIn my opinion, anyone using LLM-based assistants for coding should read this perspective published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution: Harnessing large language models for coding, teaching and inclusion to empower research in ecology and evolution, led by Natalie Cooper, and part of a special issue on the use of LLMs in ecology and evolution. These papers summarize the pros and cons of genAI/LLMs in the context of research and teaching, and their conclusions go beyond research and biological sciences.\nAnother useful resource is this course: The Bullshit Machines put together Carl T. Bergstrom and Jevin D. West. A very thoughtful and well-structured set of materials that cuts through the smoke and highlights the fact that just because a machine can write like us it does not mean it can think like us.\nAs an instructor, I am not alone in noticing that lately, a variable proportion of learners are using ChatGPT and similar tools to assist them in and after various R-related workshops. The Carpentries foundation have this interesting two-part series on teaching LLM-based coding assistants in Carpentries workshops. The results here mention patterns of usage, advantages and disadvantages of actually teaching how to use these assistants, and throughout 2025 there will be ongoing discussion about ethics, security, and how to best teach in light of these new tools.\n\nWith that out the way: the next sections on this site are split into R packages, additional extensions that work in our IDEs without shipping and installing as an R package, and a list of courses and tutorials for actually using these tools.",
